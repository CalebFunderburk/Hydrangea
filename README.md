### About

In this project I decided to create a website that will house all of my work and act as a point of contact for future employers. 

### Placeholder Content

Cook It! and Wicked Wizard 3 are simply placeholders until I finish more projects to fill in the space. Using these placeholders help by making future updates easier.
