## Project Narrative

### About

In this project I decided to create a website that will house all of my work and act as a point of contact for future employers. I started this project by creating a mockup in my notebook to get some ideas flowing. Next I took my ideas to VS Code and started typing out the basic HTML. Once the body of the page was coded, I started applying very basic positioning to my elements using CSS. 

### Placeholder Content

Run Buddy, Cook It!, and Wicked Wizard are simply placeholders until I finish more projects to fill in these spaces. Using these placeholders help by making future updates easier to implement.
